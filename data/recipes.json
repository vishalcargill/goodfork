            "Lightly oil your work surface and tip the dough onto it. Knead the dough for at least 10 mins until it becomes tighter and springy \u2013 if you have a stand mixer you can do this with a dough hook for 5 mins. Pull the dough into a ball and put in a clean, oiled bowl. Leave for 1 hr, or until doubled in size.",
            "Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a long sausage shape. Halve the dough, then divide each half into four pieces, so you have eight equal-sized portions. Roll each into a tight ball and put on a dusted baking tray, leaving some room between each ball for rising. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove for 40 mins-1 hr or until almost doubled in size.",
            "Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. When the dough is ready, dust each ball with a bit more flour. (If you like, you can glaze the rolls with milk or beaten egg, and top with seeds.) Bake for 25-30mins, until light brown and hollow sounding when tapped on the base. Leave to cool on a wire rack."

Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",

Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 20 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. When baked, drizzle with a little extra olive oil."

Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",

Bake for 25 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. Finish by brushing with beaten egg."

Rye flour can be quite dry and absorbs lots of water, if the dough looks too dry add more warm water until you have a soft dough Tip out onto your work surface and knead for 10 mins until smooth. Rye contains less gluten than white flour so the dough will not feel as springy as a conventional white loaf.",

Shape into a smooth oval loaf and pop into your tin. Cover the tin with oiled cling film and leave to rise somewhere warm for a further 1 \u2013 1.5 hr, or until doubled in size.",
            "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Remove the cling film and dust the surface of the loaf with rye flour. Slash a few incisions on an angle then bake for 30 mins until dark brown and hollow sounding when tapped. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and leave to cool for at least 20 mins before serving"

Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand warm (cool rather than hot) water, with a round-bladed knife. Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.",

Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",

Using your knuckles, flatten the dough into a rectangle about 25 x 19cm. Fold both shorter ends into the centre like an envelope, make a \u00bc turn, then flatten again into the same size and roll up very tightly, starting from one of the short ends. Roll the top of the dough in extra seeds and place in the tin with the join underneath, pressing the seeds gently into the dough. Cover with a clean tea towel. Leave for 40-45 mins, or until risen about 5cm above the top of the tin.",
            "Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 mins before ready to bake and heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for about 30 mins or until golden, covering with foil for the last 5 mins if starting to brown too quickly. Leave in the tin for 2-3 mins, then remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the baked loaf if should be firm and sound hollow."

Flatten out the pastry with your hands, wrap the dough in cling film, then chill for at least 30 mins. While the pastry is chilling, make the filling. Beat all the ingredients, except for the zest, together. Sieve the mixture, then stir in the zest.",
            "Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about the thickness of a \u00a31 coin, then lift into a 23cm tart tin. Press down gently on the bottom and sides, then trim off any excess pastry. Stab a few holes in the bottom with a fork and put back in the fridge for 30 mins.",

Bake for 10 mins, then remove the tart tin from the oven, discard the foil, and bake for another 20 mins until biscuity. When the pastry is ready, remove it from the oven, pour in the lemon mixture and bake again for 30-35 mins until just set. Leave to cool, then remove the tart from the tin and serve at room temperature or chilled."

Tip the pan if you need to combine patches of sugar that haven\u2019t melted into the liquid parts, but don\u2019t be tempted to stir. When you have a medium amber-coloured caramel, sprinkle on the spices and lemon juice. Turn the heat off.",

Start with a large slice in the centre and lay the other slices on top so it looks neat when you turn it out. When the squash is all in the pan, turn the heat on again and cook until the caramel starts to bubble. Turn the heat down and cook for about 10-15 mins, making sure the caramel doesn\u2019t burn. You want the squash to give off any water and then to start absorbing the caramel \u2013 the caramel will start to get very liquid as this happens, so turn the heat up at the end and make sure the caramel thickens up completely. Turn the heat off, drop the butter into the centre of the pan and wait for it to melt.",

Bake for 20 mins, then turn the heat down to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake for a further 20 mins. Turn out onto a plate while the tarte is hot so the squash and caramel release easily. Serve with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or ice cream."

Using an electric whisk (or wooden spoon if you\u2019ve got more time and energy), beat them together until creamy and soft. Crack in the eggs, one by one, giving a good beat after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract, then the flour and baking powder, then stir through the milk to loosen the mixture. Carefully stir in half the raspberries, making sure you don\u2019t mix too vigorously or they will fall apart.",

Scatter the marshmallows all over the cake, trying to leave a 2cm border round the edge of the tin as the marshmallows will expand when cooking, then tuck raspberries into any gaps. Return to the oven for another 10 mins until the cake has fully cooked through and the marshmallows are lightly browned and gooey. Leave for 5 mins, then ease out of the tin, cut up and eat."

            "Put the butter and chocolate into a saucepan and stir over a very gentle heat until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.",
            "Sieve the flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl. Add the sugar, breaking up any lumps if necessary. Beat together the eggs and soured cream and pour onto the flour mixture. Add the melted chocolate and mix all well together until smooth.",
            "Divide the mixture equally between the two tins and bake in the oven for about 55 mins - 1 hour. A good way to check that the mixture is equally divided is to put a cocktail stick into each mixture and the levels should be the same.",
            "To make the icing, put the butter into a bowl and beat until creamy. Add the icing sugar and cocoa a little at a time beating well between each addition. Add the milk to mix to a soft spreading consistency.",
            "To assemble, place the round cake on a large wooden board or tray (the cake will need to served on this). Place the round cake tin on the square cake about 12cm from one edge and cut around the edge of the tin. Remove the smaller piece and place at one end of the round cake to represent the ears.",
            "Using the remains of the square cake cut almost in half to give an oblong (for the fence) and a semi circle (for the wings). Place the oblong at the bottom of the owl cake. Slice the semi circle in half horizontally through the middle. Arrange one piece each side of the round cake to make the wings.",
            "Spread the butter icing all over the cake. Cut the flake bars into small pieces and arrange on the wings to represent feathers. Keep the flake crumbs. Arrange milk chocolate buttons over the body. Place chocolate fingers on the bottom cake to make the fence. Using a fork, mark the icing to make the owl\u2019s ears. Use the flake crumbs to make a v-shape between the ears like a 'widow\u2019s peak'. Arrange the white chocolate buttons in two circles to make the eyes and place a milk chocolate button in the centre of each. Use a third of the marzipan to shape a beak and use the remaining marzipan to make two feet.",
            "Place the candles on the \u2018fence\u2019 part of the cake. You can also pipe a child\u2019s name or message on the fence using writing icing."

        ],
        "steps": [
            "Make the 15cm fruit cake. You can do this up to a month in advance and wrap it in cling film. Once a week you can feed it with a little dark rum or brandy by poking holes in the top and spooning a little into the holes.",
            "Marzipan the fruitcake. Heat the apricot jam until bubbling, then take off the heat. Sieve if necessary to remove any bits. Level off the top of the fruit cake using a long serrated bread knife. Brush the top with jam and flip the cake over and position it on top of the 15cm cake board. Briefly knead the marzipan and smooth into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar. Roll out into a circle. Use a bit of string or tape measure to measure your fruit cake\u2019s top and sides so you know how far to roll out the dough. Brush the cake with apricot jam and then carefully transfer the marzipan to the cake (see picture 1). Gently smooth the top first, then ease your hands down the sides, carefully lifting and coaxing the marzipan so that it fits without overlapping (see picture 2). When you have reached the bottom edges of the cake, use a sharp knife to shave off any excess marzipan. You can do this up to a month in advance.",
            "Ice the cake drum (see picture 4). Lightly knead 500g icing and form into a ball. Dust your work surface with sifted icing sugar and roll out the icing in a circle using a tape measure to check that it is wide enough (23cm). Brush the drum with cooled boiled water and transfer the icing to the board. Gently roll over the board again, then trim the edges with a small sharp knife. Roll gently again if you like to get a really smooth finish. Watch out for fingerprints and bits of fluff as ready-to-roll icing can be quite delicate.You can do this in advance too. If you do, put it in a cake box to stop it gathering dust.",
            "Make the 23cm lemon cake. The unfilled cake will keep well if you wrap it with baking parchment and cling film for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.",
            "Buttercream the zingy lemon cake. Make buttercream by beating together the butter, icing sugar and lemon zest. You can do this the day before icing.",
            "Level off the top of the lemon cake using a long serrated bread knife. Spread a little of the buttercream onto the 23cm cake board. Turn cake upside down onto the board. Brush all over with a thin layer of the sieved apricot jam - this helps to stop crumbs getting into the buttercream. Cut the cake in half horizontally using the bread knife. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not perfect as people won\u2019t be able to see once the cake is covered. Use a palette knife to spread a layer of buttercream onto the top of the cut side of the cake on the board. Put the top layer back on and press down a little to level it. Spread the remaining buttercream on the top and sides of the cake using the palette knife to smooth the surface (see picture 3). Pop the cake in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, this will make it easier to ice.",
            "To cover the cakes in the icing, you\u2019ll need 500g for the smaller cake and 900g for the larger one. For each, gently work the icing into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar and roll it into a circle. Again use a tape measure or piece of string to ensure the circle is big enough to cover the cake. In the case of the fruitcake, brush the marzipan with cooled boiled water, then transfer the icing onto the cake and smooth it down in the same way as the marzipan. Use a cake smoother if you have one to get a really smooth finish (see picture 5). For the lemon cake, you won\u2019t need any additional gluing, the buttercream will do the job. Once you have smoothed the icing over the cake, trim it carefully. A ribbon will hide the bottom of the cake so it doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. Save any leftover icing to make the decorations. Wrap it in clingfilm and put into a freezer bag to seal out the air.",
            "To stack the cakes, use three plastic dowels, these help to keep the cake stable and level. Insert three dowels in a triangle, 2cms in from where the edges of the smaller cake will be (see picture 6). With a pen, mark where the top of the icing comes to on the dowel. Carefully pull out the dowels, you can use tweezers for this, and line them up. Pick the dowel with the highest mark, this is the length you want all the dowels to be. Score the dowels with scissors at this length and cut or snap the plastic.",
            "Put the rods back into the three holes, rounded end down. Smooth a little leftover buttercream onto cake where the dowels are. Pick the best side of the smaller cake and aim to position this at the front. Carefully lift it onto the larger one, you can use a palette knife to help you lower the cake.",
            "To decorate, pinch off a small ball of icing and leave it white. Divide the remaining icing into quarters. Dye two quarters brown. Do this by dipping a toothpick into the colouring paste and gradually adding more colour to the icing, kneading it as you go (see picture 7). Keep going until you have the colour you want and it is smoothly incorporated with no streaks. It\u2019s better to do this gradually as the colours can be quite strong and it\u2019s easy to add too much.",
            "Dye the remaining two balls of icing in your chosen pastels. Wrap all of the balls in clingfilm and pop into a freezer bag until ready to use. This will stop them from becoming crusty.",
            "Start by decorating the bottom layer. Roll out the icing, cutting out approximately 12 shapes. We did six brown teddies and alternated them with either a pink duck (three in total) or a blue duck (three in total). Paint a small amount of edible glue onto the back of each teddy and stick it on. Then repeat with the ducks, placing them between the teddies. For the top layer, we cut out 12 small bunnies, alternating brown, blue, pink, brown, blue pink etc. Stick the shapes with even spacing between them on to the cake. The number of shapes you need will depend on the size of the cutters you\u2019ve chosen.",
            "To make the teddy, roll out one small ball for the head and one slightly larger one for the body. Stick the head on top of the body. Roll out two sausages of icing one for the legs and one for the arms. Cut them in half. Stick the arms to the side of the body and flatten the ends to form little paws. Next stick on the legs, again flattening the ends to form paws. Roll two small balls of brown, flatten and cup them slightly to make ears. Make a little ball of white icing to stick onto the face to make a muzzle. Dip a toothpick into the brown colouring paste and do two dots for eyes. Roll tiny balls of icing for the nose (in brown) and buttons (in white) and stick them on. If you like, take some white icing and make pads for the feet and for the inner ears too (see picture 9).",
            "To make the rabbit, roll a sausage of pink or blue icing and snip the top and the bottom one third along. Form the top into ears and the bottom into legs. Pinch a neck about 1 cm under the ears and then snip each side upwards from the legs to just below the neck to form arms and mould them slightly (see picture 8). Make a face by dipping your toothpick back into the brown paste and draw on eyes, a nose and whiskers. Sit the teddy on top of the cake and arrange the bunny on his lap.",
            "If you like and are handy with writing icing, write the child\u2019s name on the second tier or stick a candle there."

            "500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting",
            "4g fast-action dried yeast",
            "10g fine sea salt, sea salt flakes or table salt"

            "Tip the flour into a large bowl along with the yeast. Pour over 325g room-temperature water (you\u2019ll get a more accurate amount by weighing the water, but you can also use 325ml, depending on your scales), then use your hands or a spatula to mix until a dough forms. It\u2019s important that you ensure all of the flour is mixed in, including any bits around the side of the bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 mins.",
            "Sprinkle over the salt, then work it in by stretching the dough over the salt several times until fully incorporated. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface. Use the heel of one hand to stretch the dough while you hold it with your other hand. Then, fold the dough back onto itself, turn it 90 degrees to the left and repeat. Do this for about 5 mins, or until the dough looks shinier and immediately bounces back when rolled into a tight ball or gently poked. Roll the dough into a tight ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove at room temperature for 1 hr until doubled in size. Or, for a deeper flavour, transfer to a clean bowl, cover and leave to prove in the fridge overnight until doubled in size. Cold dough is easier to work with, so overnight is best.",
            "When the dough has doubled in size and is light and pillowy, tip it out onto a work surface and knead it a few more times to knock the air out. Gather the dough into a ball and leave to rest for 5 mins. Gently form the dough ball into a tight, rounded shape on the work surface, then tip domed-side down into a proving basket or bowl lined with a clean tea towel. Leave to prove in a warm place for 40 mins-1 hr, or in the fridge for 2-3 hrs until roughly doubled in size.",
            "Put a casserole along with its lid in the oven, then heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Once the oven is at temperature, remove the casserole. Flip the dough onto a square of baking parchment, slash it using a sharp knife and use the sides of the parchment to carefully lower the dough (still on the parchment) into the hot casserole. Cover with the lid. Bake for 25 mins. Remove the lid and bake for 5-10 mins more until it has a deeply golden, crisp crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack for 40 mins before slicing. Will keep in an airtight container for up to two days."

Keep it in the fridge (it will stay dormant) and 24 hrs before you want to use it, pour half of it off and feed it with 100g flour and 100g water. Leave it at room temperature and it should become active again. The longer the starter has been dormant, the more times it will need to be refreshed \u2013 the process of pouring off half the starter and replacing it with new flour and water \u2013 to reactivate. If your starter is ready to use, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.",

Leave the levain for 8 hrs at room temperature until it becomes active. When ready, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.",

Tip in the flour and mix everything together with a rubber spatula to make a rough dough, ensuring all the flour is incorporated evenly and that there are no dry bits up the side of the bowl. Cover and leave somewhere warm for at least 30 mins, or up to 4 hrs.",

            "Wet your hands, grab the dough from one side and stretch it over itself, then repeat with the other side. This stretching technique helps develop the gluten. Pick the dough up and curl it around onto itself, then cover and leave for another 20-30 mins. Repeat this process two more times (three in total), then leave the dough for another 2-3 hrs until it\u2019s risen by about 30% and looks bubbly and soft.",
