      "1 teaspoon grated Lemon Zest"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Heat the oven to 300 degrees",
      "Dredging the shanks: pour the flour into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely)",
      "Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper",
      "One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour",
      "Discard the remaining flour",
      "Browning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat",
      "When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won’t fit without touching one another, do this in batches",
      "Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side",
      "If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit",
      "Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside",
      "The aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot",
      "Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits",
      "Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat",
      "When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel",
      "Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes",
      "Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for another minute or two",
      "The braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil",
      "Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes",
      "Add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes",
      "The braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat",
      "Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch",
      "Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer",
      "Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees",
      "Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours",
      "The gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl",
      "Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm",
      ")\r\nThe finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata",
      "Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some",
      "Using a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact",
      "The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky",
      "But if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t suffer at all",
      "Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm",
      "Finishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it",
      "Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor",
      "If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes",
      "Taste again for salt and pepper",
      "If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata",
      "Portioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person",
      "If the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts",
      "Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most",
      "Serving: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving",
      "Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce – the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon"

      "5 cloves Garlic",
      "1 Sprig Thyme",
      "1 sprig Rosemary",

      "3 Large Carrots",
      "1 Tbsp Mustard",
      "4 Mashed Potatoes"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "1 Prepare the brisket for cooking: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want",
      "If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them",
      "Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely",
      "Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart",
      "Slice through the fat, not the beef",
      "Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern",
      "Salt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes",
      "2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions",
      "Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat",
      "Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned",
      "(If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium",
      "You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear",
      ")\r\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side",
      "3 Sauté the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside",
      "There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil",
      "Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to high",
      "Sprinkle a little salt on the onions",
      "Sauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes",
      "Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes",
      "4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: Preheat the oven to 300°F",
      "Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme",
      "Move the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside",
      "Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs",
      "Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop",
      "Cover the pot, place the pot in the 300°F oven and cook for 3 hours",
      "Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly",
      "5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots",
      "Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender",
      "6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board",
      "Cover it with foil",
      "Pull out and discard the herbs",
      "7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options",
      "You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions",
      "If you serve as is, skip this step",
      "To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil",
      "Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth",
      "If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix",
      "Put into a small pot and keep warm",
      "8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast",
      "This is the \"grain\" of the meat",
      "Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices",
      "Serve with the onions, carrots and gravy",
      "Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles or polenta"
